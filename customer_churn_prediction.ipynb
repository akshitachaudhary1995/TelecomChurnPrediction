    "## **Business Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The telecommunications industry is a rapidly growing sector that is constantly evolving to meet the demands of consumers. As technology advances and user behavior changes, telecom operators face a variety of challenges that can impact their business success. In order to stay competitive and meet customer needs, it is important for telecom companies to regularly analyze their data to identify relevant problems and opportunities for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project is part of the \"telecom data\" cluster of projects, targeting the telecom industry. It is recommended to go through the [\"Exploratory Data Analysis\"](https://www.projectpro.io/data-science-use-cases/telecom-data-analysis-project) notebook before executing this project to understand the Data better. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Aim:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of a churn prediction notebook is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn or discontinue their use of a service or product. Churn prediction is a critical business problem for companies that operate on a subscription or recurring revenue model, such as telecommunications companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the project will involve building a churn prediction model, the primary focus will be on the importance of monitoring and adapting to changes in the data that may affect the accuracy and effectiveness of the model over time. The project will also emphasize the need for a feedback loop that allows for continuous improvement and refinement of the model based on new data and changing business requirements. By highlighting these concepts, the project aims to help businesses understand the importance of staying agile and adaptable in their machine learning approaches, rather than solely focusing on the accuracy of a single model.\n",

    "**What is Churn Prediction?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue using a service or product. In the context of the telecom sector, churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to switch to a competitor or terminate their contract with their current service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn prediction is a critical problem in the telecom sector, as it has a significant impact on a service provider's revenue and profitability. The telecom sector is highly competitive, and service providers are constantly vying for customers' attention. It helps service providers identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Churn prediction is a challenging problem, as it involves analyzing large volumes of data from multiple sources. Telecom service providers generate a vast amount of data from customer interactions, network performance, and billing systems. This data is typically stored in disparate systems, making it difficult to analyze and derive insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another challenge in churn prediction is the diversity of customer behavior. Customers have different reasons for leaving a service provider, and these reasons can be difficult to predict. Some customers may leave due to poor network performance, while others may switch to a competitor offering a better deal. Predicting churn accurately requires understanding these different customer behaviors and identifying the most critical predictors of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Impact of Churn Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn prediction has a significant impact on a telecom service provider's business. A high churn rate can result in a loss of revenue and profitability. On the other hand, an effective churn prediction model can help service providers identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key business impacts of churn prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Revenue Protection**: Churn prediction helps service providers protect their revenue by identifying customers who are likely to leave and taking proactive measures to retain them. This can include offering discounts, upgrading service plans, or providing additional services. By retaining customers, service providers can maintain their revenue stream and avoid the cost of acquiring new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Customer Retention**: Churn prediction helps service providers retain their existing customers by identifying their needs and preferences. By understanding why customers leave, service providers can make improvements to their service and provide a better customer experience. This can help to build customer loyalty and increase the lifetime value of a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cost Reduction**: Churn prediction can help service providers reduce the cost of acquiring new customers. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones, and churn prediction can help service providers focus their marketing efforts on the most valuable customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Competitive Advantage**: Churn prediction can provide a significant competitive advantage in the telecom sector. By retaining customers and improving the customer experience, service providers can differentiate themselves from their competitors. This can help to increase market share and profitability.\n",

    "## **Important Libraries**\n",
    " \n",
    "* **pandas**: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. Refer to [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.\n",
    " \n",
    "* **NumPy**: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today. NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. Refer to [documentation](https://numpy.org/) for more information. pandas and NumPy are together used for most of the data analysis and manipulation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Refer to [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/) for more information.\n",
    " \n",
    "* **seaborn**: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Refer to [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for more information.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Warnings**:The warnings library provides a way to handle warnings that are generated during program execution. Warnings are typically issued when there is a potential issue with code, but the code still runs without errors. The warnings module provides a way to catch these warnings and handle them in a way that is appropriate for the program. This can be especially useful when developing and debugging code, as warnings can help identify potential issues before they become errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **sys**:The sys library provides access to some system-specific parameters and functions. This library can be used to access system-level information, such as the command line arguments passed to the program, the version of the Python interpreter being used, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **xgboost**: xgboost is an open-source machine learning library designed to be highly efficient, scalable, and portable. It is a gradient boosting algorithm that is used for supervised learning problems, including regression, classification, and ranking. Refer to [documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **deepchecks**: deepchecks is an open-source library that is used for deep learning model debugging and monitoring.

    "## **Data Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data exploration is a critical step in the data analysis process, where you examine the dataset to gain a preliminary understanding of the data, detect patterns, and identify potential issues that may need further investigation. Data exploration is important because it helps to provide a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis tasks, hypothesis testing and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data exploration is also important because it can help you to identify an appropriate approach for analyzing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the various functions that help us explore and understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shape: Shape is used to identify the dimensions of the dataset. It gives the number of rows and columns present in the dataset. Knowing the dimensions of the dataset is important to understand the amount of data available for analysis and to determine the feasibility of different methods of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Head: The head function is used to display the top five rows of the dataset. It helps us to understand the structure and organization of the dataset. This function gives an idea of what data is present in the dataset, what the column headers are, and how the data is organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tail: The tail function is used to display the bottom five rows of the dataset. It provides the same information as the head function but for the bottom rows. The tail function is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it can be time-consuming to scroll through all the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe: The describe function provides a summary of the numerical columns in the dataset. It includes the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values, as well as the quartiles. It helps to understand the distribution of the data, the presence of any outliers, and potential issues that can affect the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Isnull: The isnull function is used to identify missing values in the dataset. It returns a Boolean value for each cell, indicating whether it is null or not. This function is useful to identify the presence of missing data, which can be problematic for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dropna: The dropna function is used to remove rows or columns with missing data. It is used to remove any observations or variables with missing data, which can lead to biased results in the regression analysis. The dropna function is used after identifying the missing data with the isnull function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Columns: The .columns method is a built-in function that is used to display the column names of a pandas DataFrame or Series. It returns an array-like object that contains the names of the columns in the order in which they appear in the original DataFrame or Series. It can be used to obtain a quick overview of the variables in a dataset and their names."

    "### **Outlier Detection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier detection is a critical data analysis technique that involves identifying and removing data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers are data points that lie far away from the rest of the data, and they can significantly influence the statistical analysis and machine learning models' performance. Therefore, identifying and removing outliers is essential to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches for outlier detection: parametric and non-parametric.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parametric Methods:\n",
    "Parametric methods assume that the data follows a specific distribution, such as a normal distribution. In this approach, outliers are identified by calculating the distance of each data point from the mean of the distribution in terms of the number of standard deviations. Data points that are beyond a certain number of standard deviations (usually three or more) are considered as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common parametric method is the Z-score method, which calculates the distance of each data point from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
    "Parametric methods can be useful when the data follows a known distribution, but they may not be effective when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-Parametric Methods:\n",
    "Non-parametric methods do not assume any specific distribution of the data. Instead, they rely on the rank or order of the data points. In this approach, outliers are identified by comparing the values of each data point with the values of other data points. Data points that are significantly different from other data points are considered as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantiles are an important concept in non-parametric outlier detection methods. They represent values that divide a dataset into equal-sized parts, such as quarters or thirds. The most commonly used quantiles are the median (which divides the data into two equal parts), the first quartile (which divides the data into the lowest 25% and the highest 75%), and the third quartile (which divides the data into the lowest 75% and the highest 25%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The interquartile range (IQR) is another important concept related to quantiles. It is defined as the difference between the third and first quartiles and represents the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to identify outliers by defining a range (known as the Tukey's fence) beyond which any data points are considered outliers.\n",
    "Non-parametric methods can be useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the distribution is unknown."

For instance, the 0.25 quantile is the value below which 25% of the observations fall and the 0.75 quantile is the value below which 75% of the observations fall. By calculating quantiles at various levels, we can get a better understanding of the distribution of the data and identify any observations that are too far away from the rest of the data.\n",

    "## **Data Drift Monitoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **So Why Is Drift So Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models are meant to predict on unseen data, based on previous known data. If the data or the relationships between features and the target label have changed, our model’s performance may degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting drift is an important warning sign that our model may be not as accurate on newer data (compared to the training data), and that it should be adjusted or retrained on different data. In production environments, detecting drift (and other measures derived from drift, such as model confidence) is often the only way to know that our model performance is deteriorating, as in many cases the label is unknown for some time after the prediction is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that not all changes in data represent drift. For example, periodic changes in data due to daily, weekly or seasonal changes are usually not considered drift, as they are often present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img.png](https://docs.deepchecks.com/stable/_images/patterns-of-concept-drift.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Which Types of Drift Are There?**\n",
    "In machine learning, we usually refer to 2 types of drift:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Drift**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data drift is any change in the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a dataset predicting a person’s income, the target (income) is highly correlated with high level of education (advanced academic degrees). A government plan to help people of lower social-economic status to get higher education, would create a data drift that changes how the data distributes. However, this will not change the relation between a person’s salary and their level of education, as these new graduates will be able to work in better paying professions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept Drift**\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept drift is a change in the underlying relation between the data and the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the example of predicting income using the level of education, let’s assume that a change in the job market (for example, the rise of high-tech companies) caused drift in the data: suddenly, job experience became more significant for programming jobs than a degree in computer science. Now, the relation between the level of education and the income has changed - and a person’s salary can’t be predicted from their level of education as accurately as it was on previous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept drift will almost always require some changes to the model, usually by retraining of the model on newer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img.png](https://docs.deepchecks.com/stable/_images/types-of-drift.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Drift and Concept Drift are essentially the same thing. They both refer to the phenomenon where the underlying data generating process changes over time, leading to a degradation in the performance of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model is trained on a dataset and then deployed to make predictions in the real world, it assumes that the statistical properties of the data remain constant over time. However, this is often not the case in practice. For example, in the context of natural language processing, the meanings of words can shift over time, rendering a language model trained on historical data less effective on current data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the statistical properties of the data change over time, it can lead to a situation where the model's predictions become less accurate, even if the model itself remains unchanged. This is what is known as model drift or concept drift. To mitigate this issue, techniques such as online learning or retraining the model on fresh data can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Can You Do in Case of Drift?**\n",
    "\n",
    "![img.png](https://docs.deepchecks.com/stable/_images/deepchecks_label_drift.png)\n",
    "When suspecting drift in your data, you must first understand what changed in the data - were it the features, the labels, or maybe just the predictions. In deepchecks, we show a drift score for each feature, starting with your most important features, giving you an idea of the severity of your drift, even if you’re not still sure of its source.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to manually explore your data and try to understand the root cause of your changes, in order to estimate the effect of the change on your model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrain Your Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have either kind of drift, retraining your model on new data that better represents the current distribution, is the most straight-forward solution. However, this solution may require additional resources such as manual labeling of new data, or might not be possible if labels on the newer data are not available yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retraining is usually necessary in cases of concept drift. However, retraining may still be of use even for other cases, such as data drift that caused a change in the label’s distribution, but not in the ability to predict the label from the data. In this cas, retraining the model with the correct distribution of the label can improve the model’s performance (this is not relevant when the training dataset is sampled so labels are evenly distributed).\n",

    "\n",
    "Case 1: Label is not available\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, the inference pipeline consists of two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing the new data using the same preprocessing steps that were used for the training data.\n",
    "* Using the previously trained model to make predictions on the preprocessed new data.\n",
    "* Even though we cannot retrain the model in this case, we can still check for any data drift in the new data compared to the training data. This can help us identify if there are any significant changes in the data distribution that may affect the accuracy of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: Label is available\n",
    "In this case, we can not only preprocess the new data and check for any data drift, but we can also check for model drift and decide whether to retrain the model.\n",

    "In this case, the inference pipeline consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing the new data using the same preprocessing steps that were used for the training data.\n",
    "* Checking for any data drift between the new data and the training data. If the data drift is significant, we may need to retrain the model.\n",
    "* Using the previously trained or retrained model to make predictions on the preprocessed new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we check for data drift and model drift is that the performance of a machine learning model depends on the assumption that the training data and the new data are drawn from the same distribution. If there is significant data drift or model drift, then the model may not perform well on the new data, and we may need to retrain the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Model Retraining**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model retraining is a process of updating a machine learning model using newly available data. This is done to ensure that the model remains accurate and relevant to the changing data distribution. In the given code, the model retraining is performed when there is a mismatch between the actual target value and the predicted value. In such cases, the misclassified data points are collected and added back to the training data, and the model is retrained on the combined data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, when there is data drift, the misclassified observations are used as feedback for the model to update its parameters. The feedback data is concatenated with the original training data, preprocessed, and used to train a new model. The new model is trained for a specific number of rounds and then used for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To judge if the retrained model should go ahead in production, we need to evaluate its performance on a validation set or a holdout test set. We can calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to compare the performance of the new model with the old model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the performance of the new model is better than the old model, we can deploy it in production. However, we need to be cautious of overfitting to the feedback data. To avoid overfitting, we can use techniques such as regularization, early stopping, and cross-validation while training the new model. We can also monitor the model's performance on the production data and retrain it periodically to ensure its accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is crucial to monitor the model's performance over time and update it as needed. This is because the data distribution may change over time, leading to a degradation in model performance. Therefore, regular retraining and monitoring of the model's performance are essential to ensure its continued relevance and accuracy."

    "## **Project Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we have developed a machine learning model to predict churn in a telecommunications company. We followed a systematic approach that involved data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and data drift monitoring. We evaluated three models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, and selected the best-performing model based on its evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also monitored the data drift and the model's performance regularly to ensure the model's stability over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inference pipeline allows us to make predictions for new data and handle cases where the label (churn) is not present in the input data or where drift is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that our primary goal for this project was not just to build an accurate churn prediction model, but also to demonstrate the implementation of a feedback loop in machine learning. Through continuous monitoring of the model's performance and data drift, we can provide timely feedback and improve the model's accuracy and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing a feedback loop, we can ensure that our model remains relevant and effective, even as the underlying data and business environment change. This is crucial for businesses operating in a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our model's predictions, we can draw insights into which customers are most likely to churn and why. We can also provide recommendations for business actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The company should focus on improving its customer support and services to reduce churn rates and increase customer satisfaction. This can include providing better support channels such as live chat or 24/7 support, improving response times, and training customer service representatives on effective communication skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The company should use the demographic and usage patterns of its customers to create targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to resonate with specific customer segments. This can involve analyzing customer data to identify trends and preferences and tailoring marketing messages accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The company should consider offering incentives to customers who refer friends to use their services, as this can increase customer loyalty and bring in new customers. This can include referral bonuses, discounts, or other rewards for both the referring customer and the new customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The company should explore ways to increase revenue from customers who generate less revenue, such as by offering targeted promotions or service upgrades. For example, the company could offer a premium service plan with additional features or benefits that are attractive to customers who may be more price-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The company should continue to monitor its customer satisfaction score and take action to improve it. This can involve conducting regular surveys or using social media monitoring tools to gather feedback and address any issues or concerns that customers may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning for predicting churn and its usefulness for informing business decisions."
